Updates in citsmart may be brought to this repository.\r\n\r\nBefore release version 1.0.0, Agile ITSM will be in constant refactoring/modification to be able to technological updates on original [citsmart][] technologies.\r\n\r\n## Informations\r\nTake a look at the [issues][] and [pulse][] to see where and how we are working :construction:\r\n\r\nAgile ITSM is not being built to be compatible with [citsmart][]. Data model will be modified and adequated, as well as any other characteristic that is considered necessary to modify.\r\n\r\n## Some Technologies\r\n* Programming Language: Agile ITSM is constructed on Java platform\r\n* Databases: while Agile ITSM is refactored, only PostgreSQL will be supported\r\n* Application Server: Agile ITSM will be AS/Servlet Container independent. However, it is yet JBoss AS dependent.\r\n\r\nDon't worry, Agile ITSM is being updated to make it easier to evolve it and adopt it.\r\n\r\n## :warning: WARNING\r\nDue the origin of the project, you are not encouraged to use it in a production environment before version 1.0.0, which will be the first release version.\r\n\r\n## Licence\r\nAgile ITSM is released under version 2.0 of the [Apache License][].\r\n\r\n[ITIL]: https://www.axelos.com/itil\r\n[citsmart]: https://code.google.com/p/citsmart/\r\n[issues]: https://github.com/agile-itsm/agile-itsm/issues\r\n[pulse]: https://github.com/agile-itsm/agile-itsm/pulse\r\n[GNU GPL v2]: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html\r\n[Apache License]: http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
