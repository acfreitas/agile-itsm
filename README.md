# Agile ITSM | [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/agile-itsm/agile-itsm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/agile-itsm/agile-itsm)
Agile ITSM - A free ITSM Tool for agile environments based on [ITIL][] best practices and agile culture 

## Origin
Agile ITSM is a fork of [citsmart][] (available on Google Code under GNU GPL v2 licence) will consider agile approaches and good practices for software construction. Updates in citsmart may be brought to this repository.

Before release version 1.0.0, Agile ITSM will be in constant refactoring/modification to be able to technological updates on original [citsmart][] technologies.

## Informations
Take a look at the [issues][] and [pulse][] to see where and how we are working :construction:

Agile ITSM is not being built to be compatible with [citsmart][]. Data model will be modified and adequated, as well as any other characteristic that is considered necessary to modify.

## Some Technologies
* Programming Language: Agile ITSM is constructed on Java platform
* Databases: while Agile ITSM is refactored, only PostgreSQL will be supported
* Application Server: Agile ITSM will be AS/Servlet Container independent. However, it is yet JBoss AS dependent.

Don't worry, Agile ITSM is being updated to make it easier to evolve it and adopt it.

## :warning: WARNING
Due the origin of the project, you are not encouraged to use it in a production environment before version 1.0.0, which will be the first release version.

## Licence
Agile ITSM is released under version 2.0 of the [Apache License][].
